## Handwritten Digit Recognition - Deep Learning Project

This project focuses on developing a deep learning model to recognize handwritten digits from images. Using advanced neural network techniques, the objective is to accurately classify digits (0-9) based on their visual representation. The project leverages a real-world dataset and involves various stages of preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design a machine learning system that can classify handwritten digits. The workflow involves preprocessing image data, building and training neural network models, and evaluating their performance. The key steps include feature extraction, model optimization, and metric-based evaluation.

## Key Features

# Data Preprocessing

Normalized pixel values to ensure uniform scaling.

Handled missing or corrupted images, if any.

Reshaped image data into the required input format for neural networks.

# Feature Engineering

Extracted pixel intensity values and created additional features like edge detection.

Applied data augmentation techniques, such as rotation, scaling, and flipping, to improve model robustness.

# Model Training

Implemented and compared several machine learning and deep learning models:

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

Transfer Learning using pre-trained models like VGG16 and ResNet

# Model Evaluation

Assessed the models using performance metrics such as:

Accuracy

Precision and Recall

F1 Score

Confusion Matrix

# Dataset

The dataset consists of images of handwritten digits and their corresponding labels. It is sourced from popular repositories such as the MNIST Dataset or other comparable datasets. The data includes:

Image Size: 28x28 grayscale images

Classes: 10 (digits 0 through 9)

Training Set: 60,000 images

Test Set: 10,000 images

# Results

The models were evaluated on the test dataset, and the best results achieved were:
